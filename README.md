## Description

This Project is part of Data Science Nanodegree Program by Udacity in collaboration with Figure Eight.
The initial dataset contains pre-labelled tweet and messages from real-life disaster. 
The aim of the project is to build a Natural Language Processing tool that categorize messages.

The Project is divided in the following Sections:

1. Data Processing, ETL Pipeline to extract data from source, clean data and save them in a proper database structure
2. Machine Learning Pipeline to train a model able to classify text message in categories
3. Web App to show model results in real time.

## Getting Started

<a name="dependencies"></a>
### Dependencies
* Python 3.5+ (I used Python 3.7)
* Machine Learning Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn
* Natural Language Process Libraries: NLTK
* SQLlite Database Libraqries: SQLalchemy
* Web App and Data Visualization: Flask, Plotly

<a name="installing"></a>
### Installing
Clone this GIT repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/mayukhsil/CapstoneProject_DSND.git
```
<a name="executing"></a>
### Executing Program:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/ITC.NS.csv data/Stock.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_regressor.py data/Stock.db models/regressor.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:5000/
